# Simple-Calendar
A simple calendar made with C++ Qt.  
You can double click the dates to set events with custom colors for them.  
The calendar is auto saved into registry but there is also an import and export option for moving to another device.  
I would be thankful if you point out any mistakes or have any kind of suggestion for me. Cheers.
