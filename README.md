# Simple Calendar

A simple calendar app made with C++ Qt.
## Description
The calendar dates in the application can be easily managed by double-clicking on them to create events or tasks. You have the flexibility to choose custom colors for each event, allowing you to visually distinguish between different types of activities.

To provide a seamless user experience, the calendar status is automatically saved into the registry. If you close the application, your calendar data will be preserved.
Furthermore, the application offers an import and export option, making it effortless to transfer your calendar data to another device, ensuring that your schedule remains consistent across multiple platforms.
## Installation

Navigate to project ```src``` directory and use [qmake](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmake-manual.html) to build the app.

```bash
qmake calendar.pro
```
Then make.
```bash
make
```
If you are using MSVC, you will need to run ```nmake``` instead of ```make```.
